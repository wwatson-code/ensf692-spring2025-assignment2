class Sensor:

    # Must include a constructor that uses default values
    # You do not need to provide commenting above the constructor
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    # Replace these comments with your function commenting
    def update_status(): # You may decide how to implement the arguments for this function
        pass



# The sensor object should be passed to this function to print the action message and current status
# Replace these comments with your function commenting
def print_message(sensor):
    pass



# Complete the main function below
def main():
    print("\n***ENSF 692 Car Vision Detector Processing Program***\n")





# Conventional Python code for running main within a larger program
