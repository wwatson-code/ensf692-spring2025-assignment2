# ENSF 692 Spring 2025 - Assignment 2

## üìö Learning Outcomes
* Accept user input through varied menu options
* Validate user input through exception handling
* Process data according to specifications
* Design control flow logic using data comparisons
* Develop and implement user-defined classes
* Print formatted output according to given specifications

## üíª Program Specifications
Computer vision and the related data processing allows cars to detect obstacles in their path. You are being asked to design a terminal-based application for determining a course of action depending on detected obstacles.
Your application must meet the following design specifications:
* Your user interface should prompt the user to input the following information:
  * Select 1 to update the detected traffic light colour, 2 to update whether a pedestrian is detected, 3 to update whether a vehicle is detected, 0 to end the program
  * If menu option 1, 2 or 3 are detected, the user should then be prompted to specify the detected change
    * A traffic light can be "green", "yellow", or "red"
    * Pedestrian status can be "yes" or "no"
    * Vehicle status can be "yes" or "no"
  * A course of action message should be printed following the status change
    * Any scenario where a red light, a pedestrian or a vehicle are detected should display the message "STOP"
    * A green light with no pedestrian or vehicle detected should display the message "Proceed"
    * A yellow light with no pedestrian or vehicle detected should display the message "Caution"
  * After the action message, the current status of each monitored condition should be printed
* Your input interface design should follow the provided screenshot example.
* You must validate that the provided input is correct (both menu input and status input).
* If the menu option input does not meet the criteria, you must handle a ValueError exception by providing a message back to the user and allow them to re-enter their choice without terminating the program.
* All status input must match the given values exactly (e.g. "red" not "Red").
  * While you should check that the values are valid, you do not need to handle errors/exceptions for these values
* The initial default values are a green traffic light, no pedestrian, and no vehicle.
* Your code should include and use the provided `Sensor` class and the provided user-defined functions. Provided code should remain unchanged unless otherwise specified. Details are provided in the template comments.
* You may not use any global variables. However, you may create your `Sensor` object in `main`.
* Your code must follow the conventions discussed so far in the course (comments throughout, four spaces for one indentation, spaces between variables/operators, etc.)
* All user-defined functions must be properly commented above the function header.
* Your code will be run by the TA as your end user.
* FAQs about the assignment will be answered on the D2L discussion boards. Please use the discussion boards to get clarification from me and your classmates.
* The grading rubric will be posted to D2L.

## üìù Assignment Tasks
* Make sure to review the corresponding Jupyter Notebooks and lab sessions.
* Download input_processing.py to your local computer.
* Open VSCode and start a new terminal. 
* `input_processing.py` is provided as a starting point. Fill in the header with your own information.
* Remember to test your program execution via the terminal: `python input_processing.py`
* Take a screenshot of your successful program run and upload it to your assignment repository.
* Commit your screenshot and code.
* Push your local git history to GitHub
* Submit your repository HTTPS link to the Assignment 2 D2L DropBox.
* Tip: If you want to learn more about a specific aspect of a Python object, remember to take a look at the official documentation!
